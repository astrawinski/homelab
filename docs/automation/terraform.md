# Terraform Infrastructure Automation

## Overview

Terraform will be used to define and manage the infrastructure of the homelab in a declarative manner. It'll allow for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling automated provisioning, changes, and version control of homelab resources. This is a stub for now.

## Terraform Setup

### **1. Directory Structure**

The Terraform configuration files will be located in the `terraform/` directory:

```text
terraform/
├── main.tf        # Main Terraform configuration
├── variables.tf   # Variable definitions
├── outputs.tf     # Output values
├── providers.tf   # Provider configuration
├── modules/       # Custom Terraform modules
└── terraform.tfvars # Variable values (git-ignored if sensitive)
```

## Next Steps

1. Define more Terraform modules for homelab automation.
2. Integrate Terraform with Ansible for post-provisioning configuration.
3. Automate Terraform runs using GitHub Actions or a local CI/CD pipeline.
